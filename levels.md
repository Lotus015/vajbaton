Tips for Designing & Balancing These Levels
Piece Count vs. Time Limit

For a hackathon game, aim for ~5–8 pieces in Levels 1–2, ~12–18 in Level 3, ~15 in Level 4, ~20 in Level 5, and ~25+ in Level 6 if you choose to include it. That way, players gradually learn mechanics on easier puzzles.

Visual Clarity

Use clear labels or icons on each piece so players can easily identify which part is which (for snapping).

Consider giving a subtle highlight or outline around each “snap area” when the user hovers a piece near it.

Snap Tolerance

Early levels: generous snap radius (30–40 px) so beginners aren’t frustrated.

Later levels: tighten to 15–20 px so it’s actually a challenge to line things up precisely.

Feedback & Progress

Display a small “Pieces Left: X” counter in the HUD (pulling from totalPieces – snappedPieces.size).

Once a piece is snapped correctly, change its appearance (e.g. reduce opacity or add a green check overlay) so players see their progress.

Level Themes

Even though the mechanics stay the same, you can style each level differently (dark mode vs. light mode, different color accents) to keep things visually fresh.

Variations

For a mid-level twist, you could rotate one or two pieces by 90° initially (so players must rotate them before snapping). That requires using Matter’s rotation APIs in the initial config (e.g. angle: Math.PI/2) and checking for both correct position and rotation before snapping.

Sample Level Progression Summary
Level 1: “Newsletter Card” (6 pieces)

Level 2: “Feature Section” (8 pieces)

Level 3: “Navbar + Hero + Footer” (18 pieces)

Level 4: “Base Page + Login Modal” (13 pieces)

Level 5: “Mini Dashboard” (20 pieces)

(Bonus) Level 6: “E-Commerce Product” (26 pieces)

By following these examples, you’ll give players a straightforward “break & rebuild” path that gradually ramps up the number of draggable pieces, the layout complexity, and the precision needed for snapping. Good luck crafting the final level data (e.g. the exact x, y, w, h coordinates) based on your design mocks—once you have those, plugging them into the levelConfigs.ts and Matter.js setup is straightforward. Have fun building!
